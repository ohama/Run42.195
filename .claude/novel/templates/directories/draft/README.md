# Draft Directory

**Purpose:** Output manuscripts. This is where the actual prose lives.

**Who Edits:** Generated by `/novel:write`, revised by `/novel:revise`, but you can edit directly.

**When Updated:** During drafting and revision phases.

## Subdirectories

```
draft/
├── scenes/      # Individual scene files (ch01_s01.md, ch01_s02.md, ...)
├── chapters/    # Compiled chapter files (ch01.md, ch02.md, ...)
└── versions/    # Version snapshots (v1_draft/, v2_revised/, ...)
```

---

## File Naming Convention

**Scenes:** `chXX_sYY.md`
- `XX` = Chapter number (01-99)
- `YY` = Scene number within chapter (01-99)
- Example: `ch03_s02.md` = Chapter 3, Scene 2

**Chapters:** `chXX.md`
- Compiled from all scenes in that chapter
- Generated by `/novel:compile`

**Versions:** `vN_description/`
- `N` = Version number (1, 2, 3...)
- `description` = Brief label (draft, revised, final)
- Contains complete manuscript snapshot

## Scene File Structure

Each scene file follows this format:

```markdown
---
scene_id: ch01_s01
chapter: 1
scene: 1
pov: Alice

## Workflow

1. **Plan:** `/novel:outline` creates beat_plan.md
2. **Draft:** `/novel:write` generates scene files in `scenes/`
3. **Check:** Checker agents add notes to scene files
4. **Revise:** `/novel:revise` updates scene files
5. **Compile:** `/novel:compile` creates chapter files in `chapters/`
6. **Version:** `/novel:snapshot` creates version in `versions/`

---

## Editing Tips

1. **Edit scenes, not chapters:** Chapters are regenerated from scenes
2. **Preserve frontmatter:** The YAML header is used by agents
3. **Keep checker notes:** They help track what was addressed
4. **Commit after revisions:** Each revision should be a git commit

---

## Version History

Use `versions/` for major milestones:

```
versions/
├── v1_first_draft/       # Complete first draft
├── v2_after_revision/    # After revision pass
└── v3_final/             # Ready for publication
```

Versions are full copies, not diffs. Use git for fine-grained history.

*Draft is the destination. All other directories serve this one.*
