# Beats Directory

**Purpose:** Story structure layer. These files bridge canon (what the story is) and draft (the actual prose).

**Who Edits:** Generated by `/novel:outline` and `/novel:plan`, but you can edit for adjustments.

**When Updated:** During planning phase, before drafting begins.

## Beat Plan Structure

The beat plan is the primary working document for drafting:

```markdown
## Chapter 1: The First Step

### Scene 1: ch01_s01
- **POV:** Alice
- **Setting:** School bus stop, January morning
- **Beats:**
  1. Alice dreads crowded bus
  2. Makes impulsive decision to walk
  3. Discovers unexpected pleasure in movement
- **Word Target:** 2,000-2,500
- **Threads:** Introduces "walking habit" thread
```

---

## Outline vs. Beat Plan

**Outline:**
- High-level structure (acts, turning points)
- Focused on story arc, not prose
- Changes rarely after initial planning

**Beat Plan:**
- Scene-level detail
- Includes POV, word counts, specific beats
- May evolve as drafting reveals needs

---

## Editing Tips

1. **Don't over-plan:** Leave room for discovery during drafting
2. **Note threads:** Track what each scene introduces or resolves
3. **Balance POV:** Ensure POV characters get appropriate coverage
4. **Word targets:** Keep realistic (2,000-3,000 per scene typical)

## Example Beat Entry

```markdown
### Scene 3: ch01_s03

- **POV:** Alice
- **Setting:** Home, evening
- **Beats:**
  1. Parents notice Alice came home late
  2. Alice lies about taking bus (introduces conflict)
  3. Private moment: Alice maps tomorrow's walking route
- **Word Target:** 1,500-2,000
- **Threads:**
  - Continues: "walking habit"
  - Introduces: "parental concern"
- **Emotional Arc:** Excitement mixed with guilt
```
