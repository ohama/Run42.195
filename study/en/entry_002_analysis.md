# PART 1: EVERYDAY EXPRESSIONS (일상 표현)

## 1.1 Counting & Frequency Expressions

### "Four days, eight bus rides."

**Original Korean:** "4일 동안 버스를 8번 탔다"

**Structure:** Number + noun, number + noun (parallel structure for impact)

**Why This Works:**
- 숫자를 나열해 반복의 고단함 강조
- 완전한 문장 없이 사실만 전달
- 리듬감 있는 표현

**Similar Counting Structures:**

| Example | Context |
|---------|---------|
| "Three tests, three failures." | 시험 실패 |
| "Five interviews, zero callbacks." | 취업 활동 |
| "Ten messages, no reply." | 연락 무시 |
| "Two weeks, fifteen rejections." | 거절의 연속 |

**Frequency Expressions:**

| Expression | Korean | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| every day | 매일 | "I take the bus every day." |
| every morning | 매일 아침 | "Every morning is hell." |
| every time | 매번 | "Every time I get off the bus..." |
| twice a day | 하루에 두 번 | "I ride twice a day." |
| four times | 네 번 | "I felt nauseous four times." |

**Practice:**
```

### "The first week is already over."

| "The semester is already half over." | 학기가 벌써 반이나 지났어. |
| "I've already done that." | 벌써 그거 했어. |

**Contrast with "Still":**
- "Already" (벌써) - 예상보다 빠름
- "Still" (아직) - 예상보다 늦음

```
"It's already 10 PM." (벌써 10시야 - 시간이 빨리 감)
"It's still only 10 PM." (아직 10시밖에 안 됐어 - 시간이 느리게 감)
```
