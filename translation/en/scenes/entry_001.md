# Monday, March 4, 2024

Cloudy. The wind was cold.

---

I'm a middle schooler now.

When I opened my eyes this morning, it didn't feel real. I put on my new uniform and looked in the mirror, wondering if that was actually me standing there. I don't look all that different from when I was in sixth grade.

"Doyun, breakfast!"

Mom's voice sent me to the kitchen. Seaweed soup sat on the table.

"It's your first day, so leave early. Don't miss the bus."

"Okay."

"Lunch is at school, right? What do you want for dinner?"

"Anything's fine."

I slurped down the soup and grabbed my bag. Mom followed me to the front door.

"Nervous? First day and all?"

"Not really."

I was, actually. But saying so felt embarrassing.

On the walk to the bus stop, the wind cut right through me. March, but it still felt like winter. I shoved my hands into my coat pockets and kept walking.

The stop was already crowded when I got there. Mostly adults heading to work, but a few kids in uniforms like me.

The bus arrived.

The moment the doors opened, I froze. It was packed. I had to squeeze my way through the bodies. I tapped my card and got shoved inside, barely able to breathe.

The smell.

Sweat, perfume, something damp. All of it mixed together and hit my nose. I tried to move toward the window, but people blocked every inch. Someone's bag pressed into my side. A man's coat hung right in front of my face.

The bus started moving.

Every turn sent everyone swaying. Me too. I reached for a handle but couldn't grab one, so I ended up clutching the back of the person in front of me. I mumbled "sorry," but I don't think they heard.

My stomach started churning.

I've always gotten carsick on long rides. But this... this was different. No way to open a window, surrounded by this smell, this swaying, this suffocation.

*What if I throw up?*

That thought made it worse. Cold sweat broke out on my forehead. I closed my eyes. Just prayed we'd get there soon.

When I got off at the school stop, I collapsed onto a bench.

I took deep breaths. One, two, three. Cold air filled my lungs. My stomach finally started to settle.

*Is this going to happen every single day?*

Forty minutes by bus from home to school. That's my commute now. In elementary school, it was a ten-minute walk. Middle school changed everything.

I sat on the bench and looked up at the school building. Big. Unfamiliar. Somewhere inside was my classroom. New classmates. New teachers.

But honestly, I was more worried about the bus than any of that.

*I have to get on that bus again tomorrow.*

Just thinking about it made my stomach turn again.

---

The classroom buzzed with chatter when I walked in. I found my seat. Third row by the window.

"Hey, where do you catch the bus?"

The kid next to me spoke up. He had an outgoing face.

"Huh? What?"

"The bus. I get on at Jocheon."

"Oh, same area."

"Really? Which number?"

"201."

"No way, same as me! Did I see you this morning? I don't think I did."

"I don't know... too many people."

"Right? Insane, isn't it? Total hell."

He laughed. I laughed too. Hell. That was exactly the right word.

"I'm Kang Minseo. You?"

"Kim Doyun."

"Doyun? Let's ride the bus together. It's harder alone."

"Uh... sure."

Minseo. Just like that, I made my first friend.

I'm writing this diary now that I'm home.

If someone asked how my day was, honestly, all I can think about is the bus. I barely remember my homeroom teacher's face. Can't recall what I had for lunch.

But the bus. That smell, that suffocation, that nausea—crystal clear.

*Do I really have to do this for a whole year?*

No, not a year. Three years. All of middle school.

The thought is overwhelming.

Still, I learned one thing today. I'm not the only one struggling. Minseo called it hell too.

Tomorrow, I have to take the bus again.

I should just go to bed early. Tomorrow's goal: don't throw up on the bus.
