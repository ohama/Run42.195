# Thursday, March 7, 2024

Clear skies, but the wind was still cold.

---

The first week is already over.

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Four days, eight bus rides. Four to school, four back home.

And in those four days, I felt nauseous four times.

The morning bus is the problem. Going home isn't so bad. Fewer people, and I can sit down. But mornings... every morning is hell.

Just like Minseo said. Actual hell.

---

This morning, as usual, the bus was packed. Minseo and I planned to ride together, and the moment we met at the stop, he let out a sigh.

"Dude, look at that. Full again today."

The bus was approaching in the distance. Through the windows, I could see people crammed inside, standing wall to wall.

"Ugh, gotta squeeze in again."

Minseo grumbled. I didn't say anything. Talking would only make my stomach worse.

The bus stopped. The doors opened. People poured off. We took the chance to climb on.

"Let's head to the back."

Minseo pushed his way in first. I followed. My bag kept getting hit from all sides. Someone's elbow pressed into my back.

We barely found a spot near the rear door. I grabbed a handle. The bus started moving.

"Hey, you look pale again."

Minseo looked at my face and said.

"A little... nauseous."

"Motion sickness? Try getting closer to the window. Get some air at least."

"Can't. Too many people."

"Man."

Minseo shook his head. Then he pulled something out of his pocket.

"Here."

It was candy. Peppermint.

"Eat it. They say it helps with motion sickness."

"... Thanks."

I put the candy in my mouth. The mint flavor spread across my tongue. My stomach settled a little. Just a little.

---

When we got to school, I sat on a bench. Yesterday was the same. The day before too. And the day before that. Every time I get off the bus, I have to sit and catch my breath first.

Minseo stood next to me.

"Dude, is it like this for you every day?"

"... Yeah."

"That's rough. Shouldn't you see a doctor or something?"

"I'm fine. I've always gotten motion sickness."

"That's not 'getting motion sickness.' Your face is literally green."

Minseo said it like a joke, but I could tell he was worried.

"I'll feel better soon."

I managed a smile. A forced one, but still.

---

During class, I looked out the window.

I could see the school field. Kids in gym clothes were running around.

*Doesn't that tire them out?*

I don't really like running. Actually, to be honest, I'm bad at it. In elementary school, I was near the bottom in the endurance run. Even a little running makes me gasp for air, my side hurts, and my legs get heavy.

I don't have much stamina. I know that.

*Maybe the motion sickness is because I'm weak?*

I don't know. Maybe I'm just like this.

The kids outside finished a lap around the field. They looked tired but also like they were having fun.

I could never be like that.

---

The bus home was better.

Around 4 PM, there were fewer people. I could sit. I could open the window.

Cool air came in. The bus still swayed, but sitting made it easier. My stomach didn't churn.

*I wish I could ride at this time every day.*

But that's impossible. School starts at 8:30, so I have to catch the 7:30 AM bus. Right in the middle of rush hour.

I sighed.

---

On the way home, I thought about it.

Is there any way other than the bus?

Bike? Jeju has lots of hills. And I'm not great at biking either.

Motorcycle? Middle schoolers can't ride those.

Mom's car? Her work hours don't match mine.

Taxi? Too expensive every day.

... Walking?

How long would it take to walk to school?

I opened the map on my phone. About 7 kilometers from home to school. An hour and twenty minutes on foot.

*That's insane.*

Walk for an hour and twenty minutes to get to school? That's way too long. The bus only takes 40 minutes.

It was a stupid idea.

I just have to take the bus. Every day, for three years.

---

Writing this diary, I'm thinking.

Once again, all I've written about is the bus. The bus takes up more space in my head than what I learned at school or what I ate.

This probably isn't healthy.

But what can I do? I have to get on that bus again tomorrow morning.

I still have some of the candy Minseo gave me. I'll have one tomorrow too.

Mondays are the hardest. After resting for two days, my body loses its adjustment.

I should rest well this weekend.

And when Monday comes... I'll ride the bus again.

That's my middle school life.
