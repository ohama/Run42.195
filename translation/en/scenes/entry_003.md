# Monday, March 11, 2024

Clear skies. The rapeseed flowers are starting to bloom.

I missed the bus today.

I didn't hear my alarm. I stayed up late watching YouTube last night, and that was the problem. When I opened my eyes, it was 7:23. The bus comes at 7:30.

"What?!"

I jumped out of bed. Mom had already left for work. Dad too. Only my little sister was still asleep in her room.

Seven minutes.

I had to wash up, get dressed, and make it to the bus stop in seven minutes. Impossible.

But I tried anyway. Just splashed some water on my face, threw on my uniform, grabbed my bag, and ran out the door.

7:29.

I could see the bus stop. I could see the bus too. In the distance. Already pulling away.

"Ah..."

Too late.

---

The next bus isn't until 8:05. I'd have to wait 35 minutes. That would get me to school around 8:45. Late. My first time being late.

*What do I do.*

I just stood there, blank. The March morning air was cold. I hadn't eaten breakfast, so I was hungry. My hair was a mess.

That's when it hit me.

*What if I walk?*

I remembered searching it up before. Seven kilometers, one hour and twenty minutes. It's 7:30 now, so if I walk, I'd arrive around 8:50. About the same as taking the next bus.

*But walk for an hour and twenty minutes?*

It seemed crazy. But either way I was going to be late, so what's the difference?

I started walking.

---

The first ten minutes, I was annoyed.

Why didn't I hear the alarm? Why didn't I put my phone down last night? Why am I so stupid? These thoughts kept swirling in my head.

But as I walked, my mindset started to shift.

The air was different.

Not that stuffy smell inside the bus. March morning air. Cold, clean, a little damp. The air flowing into my nose felt refreshing.

*Huh?*

Without realizing it, I took a deep breath. Cold air filled my lungs. A cool, clearing feeling in my chest.

Something I could never do on the bus.

---

Once I left the village, I reached the tangerine orchards.

Fields not yet harvested. Morning sunlight filtered through the leaves. Along the road, rapeseed flowers were starting to bloom. Patches of yellow here and there.

*I never knew this was here.*

These were landscapes I'd only ever glimpsed through the bus window. And even then, barely, over people's shoulders. But now they were right beside me. Close enough to touch.

I heard birds singing.

I don't know what kind. Starlings? Magpies? Whatever birds sing in the morning. Their songs rang clear. Sounds I'd never heard from inside the bus.

I heard my footsteps too.

My sneakers hitting the asphalt. A steady rhythm. Left, right, left, right.

Strangely, I started feeling good.

---

Around forty minutes in, my legs started to ache.

I've never walked this long before. My calves were pulling, the soles of my feet were burning. My bag was heavy. My shoulders hurt.

*Maybe this was a bad idea.*

I thought about taking a break. But stopping would make me even later. I just kept walking.

It was hard. Honestly, it was hard.

But it was better than getting motion sickness on the bus.

That feeling of being about to throw up. That suffocating stuffiness. None of that. Just my legs hurting.

*Sore legs... I can handle that.*

That's what I realized.

---

8:40.

I could see the school.

I passed through the front gate, breathing hard. I got there ten minutes earlier than expected. The map said an hour and twenty minutes, but it only took an hour and ten. Maybe because I walked a little fast.

Late is still late. But something felt strange.

It wasn't bad.

Actually, honestly, it felt kind of good.

I walked into the classroom. The teacher looked at me.

"Kim Doyun, you're late?"

"I'm sorry."

"Come earlier next time."

"Yes."

I was relieved the teacher didn't say anything more.

I sat down. Minseo whispered from beside me.

"Hey, why are you late? Miss the bus?"

"Yeah."

"Did you catch the next one?"

"No, I walked."

"What? Walked?"

Minseo's eyes went wide.

"You're crazy. You walked all the way here? How long did that take?"

"An hour and ten minutes."

"Wow, seriously?"

Minseo looked shocked. I was shocked too. That I actually did it.

I'm home now, writing this diary.

Today was a strange day.

I was annoyed that I missed the bus. Tired from walking over an hour. Embarrassed to be late.

But.

I don't feel bad.

Actually, kind of... refreshed?

Walking to school for an hour was better than sitting nauseous on the bus for forty minutes. It was tiring, but my stomach didn't churn. I didn't feel like throwing up. My head didn't hurt.

I saw the rapeseed flowers. I heard the birds. I breathed the morning air.

Things I couldn't do on the bus.

*Should I walk again?*

The thought crossed my mind.

But no. An hour and ten minutes is too long. Today I walked because I had no choice, not because I wanted to.

Still.

I learned something today. The bus might not be the only answer.

My legs are a bit sore. I'll probably have muscle pain tomorrow.

But strangely, I feel good.

Why?

I don't know. I just do.
