# Translation Plan: 제주 소년의 마라톤 도전기

## Project Overview

**Source:** 제주 소년의 마라톤 도전기 (Korean)
**Target:** English translation for adult readers (40s demographic)

## Translation Guidelines

### Target Audience
- Adults in their 40s
- Readers who appreciate coming-of-age stories
- Those interested in running/marathon culture

### Tone & Style
- Natural, fluent English (not literal translation)
- Accessible to native English speakers
- Preserve the authentic voice of a 14-year-old Korean boy
- Maintain cultural authenticity while ensuring readability

### Key Considerations
1. **Cultural elements:** Keep Korean names, places (Jeju), and cultural references with context where needed
2. **Running terminology:** Use standard English running/marathon vocabulary
3. **Diary format:** Maintain the personal, reflective tone of diary entries
4. **Age-appropriate voice:** Capture the growth from a reluctant middle schooler to a determined young runner

## Source Material

- **Format:** Diary entries (104 total)
- **Timeline:** March 2024 - March 2025 (1 year)
- **Word count:** 108,456 words (Korean)
- **Location:** Manuscripts in `manuscript/` directory
